It was then used in the 1996 David Cronenberg movie CRASH starring James Spader and Holly Hunter. In this movie that characters reprise the actor James Deans fatal 1955 accident in his original Little Bastard. Though it is titled as a 1957 VW, THIS IS NO KIT CAR. It boasts a 3 inch twin tube ladder frame that runs the length of the car. The main body and floor pans are riveted and bonded to the frame rails which makes this car extremely rigid. It is only the 62nd Beck ever produced and it bares the factory serial number 00628. Many period correct options have been installed by its owner over the years including GT outside mirrors, leather rear bonnet straps, conversion to original style 5 bolt wheels with front disc brakes. In 2010 the engine was updated by Bergmann to a 2498 CC with period correct Porsche style fan shroud with a cost of $7000. This historic vehicle is well documented and has thick files detailing past work, maintenance and history. STOCK/INV. NUMBER:",

It caused a sensation, which persuaded William Lyons to put it into production. The 120 in its name referred to its 120 mph top speed, which made the XK120 the world's fastest standard production car at the time of its launch. It was available in two convertible versions: the roadster (OTS, for open two-seater), and the drop head coupe (DHC), as well as a closed, or fixed-head coupe (FHC). The Jaguar XK120 is a grand example of a car that continues to define the sports-car concept. Offered from a long-term Midwest ownership, is this desirable last production year XK120 Special Equipment Coupe. Just coming out of a lengthy garage storage, the car appears to have received its current restoration many years ago and presents as a great candidate for a future freshening. The XK Coupes are highly prized for their graceful curves and opulent wood adorned cabins, especially this example with the prized M powerplant. Equipped with its original numbers-matching block and later XK140 C-Type head (G7144-8S), the Jaguar is currently in running order for mobility, although a complete service will be required before any road use. XK Fixedhead Coupe possess a timeless French inspired beauty, their style and solid drivability are a favorite among enthusiasts.

            "body": " Mercedes-Benz has one of the most diverse and extensive portfolios in history. Mercedes-Benz built heavy trucks, buses, and military vehicles as well as basic sedans, beautiful and exclusive luxury cars and some of the greatest racing cars in history. In the 1930s, you could have had the ultra-exclusive, 100 mph 540K in any number of coachbuilt configurations. But if you were a person of serious importance, you would have been driven in a 770K the Grosser Mercedes. These massive machines were reserved for heads of state and military leaders and featured some of the most advanced engineering seen on any pre-war automobile. By the 1960s Mercedes-Benzs post-war recovery was complete and they saw sufficient demand for an ultra-luxurious limousine to take on the likes of the Cadillac Series 75 Fleetwood and Rolls Royce Phantom V. The 600-series was born, known internally as the W100. Available in four-door short wheelbase or six-door, long wheelbase Pullman configuration, the 600 was simply one of the finest and most over-engineered cars in history. The six-door Pullman could be had with a standard body or an open, landaulet body. Unlike a body-on-frame Cadillac, the 600 used advanced unitary construction that was so strong, the rear roof could be cut off without effecting rigidity. Options were limited to the imagination and budget of the buyer and cars often included front and rear air conditioning, separate stereos, refrigerator, even television and telephones. A new 6.0 Liter V8 with Bosch fuel injection was developed for the 600. It produced 250 hp and a thumping 370 ft-lbs of torque, enough to allow the 6,100lb Merc to hang with a Porsche 911T in a straight line. Hydraulics were incorporated to silently operate the windows, trunk lid, power seats and sunroof. The 600 quickly became the ultimate symbol of power and prestige and was the favored by government officials, royalty, movie stars, dictators and cult leaders alike. The 600 remained in very limited production from 1964-1981 and a total of 2,677 were built, most of which on a made-to-order basis. This 1969 600 Pullman long wheelbase is configured with the rare, four-door body with rear sunroof. It shows 57,200 miles and has a nicely maintained driver-quality feel to it. The big steel body is straight, solid and displays a moderate patina on the original black paint. Chrome and brightwork are similarly sound and well preserved, with good sheen and only an occasional ding or two, not unheard of from 45 years of service. Inside the opulent cabin, you find huge swathes of deep red leather and delightfully cool Zebrano wood trim. The original leather is in very nice condition overall, with only a split on the drivers seat detracting from the otherwise fine interior. Being a long-wheelbase Pullman, luxury features abound. This example was well optioned with a divider window, a very rare rear sunroof, rear air con, rear Becker audio, a bar, and rear facing jump seats. Out on the road, this 600 Pullman lives up to the solid good looks and delivers a very satisfying drive. All hydraulics and mechanical systems have been well maintained and perform admirably. Simply put, this Pullman has never been restored because it has never needed it. Careful maintenance and use have preserved it in a satisfyingly original state that will reward with many more years of service. STOCK/INV. NUMBER: 5326",

            "body": " For the Earls Court Motor Show in 1948, the coming-out party for the postwar British car industry, Jaguar featured a low, sleek sports car built to showcase the new twin-cam straight-six dubbed the XK. Jaguar boss William Lyons had also decided after the war to drop the name of his company, SS, in favor of the much more evocative, powerful name of its pre-war SS 100 sports car: Jaguar. The sports car that debuted at Earls Court became known as the XK 120, XK for the new engine; 120 for its top speed. Lyons hadnt really intended the XK120 to be anything more than a one-off showpiece for the engine, but the car caused a sensation that he couldnt ignore. One journalist even commented that all preconceived notions as to what was a series-production sports car disappeared overnight. Indeed, the XK 120 became one of the most revered automobiles of the postwar era and is highly collectible today. This Jaguar XK 120 Roadster is a full ground up restored car finished in Old English White over a red Connolly leather interior. It has steel wheels, wide whitewall tires, Lucas headlamps and driving lamps, rear wheel spats, tonneau cover and new side curtains. As a properly and attentively restored car that has seen some light use, this is the perfect XK 120 to enjoy on spirited drives, just as it was designed to be. The purest and most elegant of the original XK series, the XK 120 Roadster (known as the Open Two Seater in the English-speaking world) is a thoroughly rewarding car both to look at and to drive, and this is an ideal example that is ready to be driven and enjoyed immediately.

Mechanically. all is original and intact;the motor has not been turned and it is impossible to know its actual condition. The body is good with a few dents and some rust, the drivers door has one rust hole but other than that the doors hang right and it will make a great start to building a valuable collector car. Part of the floorboards have rusted out so removal and installation of new floors is essential. The front seat is bad but there is enough of it to complete a reconstruction. The hood had a broken hinge on the center piece but we have obtained a new one. All the chrome pieces need re-chroming. This is a rare and elegant car that is ready to rebuild and priced to sell. If you might be interested in a challenging project with a highly rewarding outcome, then this might be the car for you as she will blossom into a beautiful vehicle. If you want to know more about the car - CALL ME - (978) 771-8375 If you would like to talk about a purchase - CALL ME (978) 771-8375 My name is Paul please call me direct with any questions - my cell phone is always with me at (978) 771-8375 or you can email me anytime at paul@silverstonemotorcars.com I promise you will enjoy your experience at Silverstone Motorcars.

This stunning and wicked fast King of the Road Mustang convertible classic comes with the original, numbers matching, engine and transmission. It also comes in the original Acapulco Blue paint color. The current owner bought the car in 1988 and immediately started restoration, which was completed in 1990. It remains in his possession, stored in a controlled environment in the Chicago area. This pristine classic convertible Mustang has been driven just over 10,000 miles since the restoration. The 1968 Mustang is nicely optioned with a 4 speed transmission, power front disc brakes, power steering and a tilt-away steering wheel. The engine was rebuilt and bored .030, balanced and blueprinted. During the restoration, the suspension, the brakes and the gas and brake lines were replaced. A stainless steel exhaust system was also added. The differential is the original N case 4 pin Posi-trac with 31 spline rear axles. The current gear ratio is 3:91. The original 3:50 differential goes with the car. A Pertronix electronic ignition keeps the original look under the hood, yet improves performance. Five 10 spoke Shelby wheels with five Eagle GT+4 tires are installed and the Mustang has been upgraded with Bosch H4 headlights. An aftermarket Alpine AM/FM stereo cassette player has replaced the original AM, but the original goes with the car. The typical price for a GT500KR in this condition was well over $200K a few years ago. With the market coming back, this is an opportunity to own an excellent investment. You could buy it now, enjoy it's company and list this classic Mustang for sale in a few years! STOCK/INV. NUMBER: 50265",

This Mustang Shelby has been fully restored without ruining the unique racing heritage. A log book is included with the purchase showing a racing history at Daytona, where it placed third, and at successful venues throughout the western US. Under the fiberglass hood is a K code engine, modified with a 715 cfm, 4 bbl carb sitting on top of a high rise intake manifold. Fabricated Tri Y headers feed dual side exhausts with glass pack mufflers. An aluminum case Borg Warner T-10 transmission, reinforced front A arms, rear axle trailing arms, and Koni shocks, big brakes and quick ratio steering made it a formidable competitor. To make it a 2 seater under the B Production homologation requirements, the rear seat was removed and a package shelf installed.

            "body": " In the late 1990s Carroll Shelby decided to build a sport car from scratch. In years past, the Shelbys that built his legendary status as an automotive icon were all improvements to an existing design. These included the AC Ace, which became the Shelby Cobra, the Ford Mustang which morphed into the Shelby GT350, and modifications of various Chrysler products like the GLH, among others. Carroll Shelby had never built a performance car from the ground up, until he designed the 1999 Shelby Cobra Series 1. It was the street car he was most proud of, and the only car he had a hand in designing with no constraints. The end result is a beautiful, limited edition performance Shelby, with acceleration and handling that testifies to his legacy as one of the greatest car builders that ever lived. This Shelby is one of the final 8 or 9 Series 1s built in 2005, after a particularly long production hiatus. Its a Shelby that is extremely rare. Less than 5 of these were painted red from from the factory, and even fewer were equipped with all the options this one enjoys. The equipment includes a supercharger, heavy duty clutch, oversize brakes, convertible top, AM/FM/CD player, air conditioning, power windows, power locks and more. The engine is a 4.0L supercharged GM V8 with over 500 HP, mated with a 6 speed transaxle. It can do 0-60 in just over 3 seconds. Even by todays standards, this is one of the quickest cars on the road. If youve ever wanted to own a piece of performance history, heres your chance. This one belongs to a customer on the East Coast and is available for inspection. Call or fill out our contact form if youd like to know more! STOCK/INV. NUMBER: 50261",

Since, the Viper acquired an impressive competition history and Dodge continued to develop the performance and overall stage presence that the Viper still commands to this day. The 2005 Dodge Viper SRT 10 Roadster offered here commands attention where ever it is driven. The car is powered by its 8.3 liter V10 producing 500 horsepower and 525 pound feet of torque. All of this power is transferred via its six speed manual gearbox and delivered by its massive rear wheels. At just 14528 miles from new, the car stands tall is all aspects. The Copperhead Orange factory paint is excellent and all areas of the car remain professionally detailed. The black interior features suede inserts with complimenting stitching. This is a two owner car that has been adult driven and properly maintained. Performance upgrades include a short throw shifter, Borla Exhaust and an upgraded Sony radio. For over 20 years, the Viper has thrilled drivers and scared passengers. They are brutally powerful cars that remain at the top of the heap in American performance.

            "body": " For those of you tired of the same old Ford and Chevy rods, perhaps this 1933 Plymouth roadster will be a breath of fresh air. Long, low, and sleek, you can see where the Prowler gets its handsome good looks, and with a gorgeous tan interior and a rumbling small block V8 its more than just a unique look. Both the body and chassis are from Custom 33 in Indiana, and they seem to have found the sweet spot for unique rods. The full-fendered look and lowered belt line give this sweet roadster a very sporting look thats a little bit old school and a little bit 21st century slick. Its fiberglass, of course, but that also means that fit and finish are exemplary, with a solid feeling going down the road. The raked-back grille and high-perched headlights are definitely a welcome change over the usual stuff and you can see a bit of Prowler influence (or is it vice-versa) in the dovetailed rear fenders. The open hood sides are as much styling element as functional upgrade and with a fixed windshield, it has a more substantial look than most roadsters. The sizzling red paint is beautifully applied with almost no signs of use and while there isnt much chrome, the bright stuff that is on the car, including the grille and headlights, is like new. You may have noticed that the Plymouth body is a bit longer than the usual Ford or Chevy, and that pays big dividends inside, where theres plenty of room for two folks with long legs. The nicely stitched vinyl upholstery does a fairly good impersonation of leather and the pleated pattern is repeated on the door panels for a cohesive look. Tan carpets help insulate passengers from noise and heat and a custom center console brings a bit of the red exterior inside the car. Cool Dolphin white-faced gauges are a little bit retro and a little bit modern, which is the perfect choice in this 33 Plymouth. Theres also a billet steering wheel on a tilt column to help you get comfortable and that custom center console also houses speakers for the AM/FM/CD stereo head unit in the center of the dash. The trunk is outfitted to match and uses the same materials for a consistent, high-quality look. A 350 cubic inch Chevy V8 provides the power, and the color-matched powerplant looks great peeking out from under the one-piece hood. Finned valve covers and air cleaner add an old-school look, while a Holley carburetor and block-hugger headers help build some horsepower. Polished aluminum is the dominant theme, but it isnt over-done, so you can drive it or show it without worries. A TH350 3-speed automatic transmission feeds a 9-inch Ford rear end, so the rest of the powertrain is plenty tough for the rigors of a cross-country cruise. Even better, the custom coil-over suspension rides rather well and handles great thanks to a rack-and-pinion steering system and a 4-link setup out back. Four-wheel disc brakes should be standard equipment on anything that can go this fast, and it definitely has the right soundtrack with a pair of Flowmasters making the music. Gorgeous oversized Torque Thrust-looking wheels give it just a bit of rake and carry low-profile performance radials for a modern look. Stand out from the crowd with this awesome little Plymouth and youll probably find that youre not alone in thinking that different is definitely better. Call now! STOCK/INV. NUMBER: 2148-ATL",

It is offered As-Is, not covered by a warranty. - Pampered, Preserved, and Iconic... 1993 Mazda (FD) RX-7 R-1 VIN: JM1FD3313P0202748 Mint Condition, Unmodified Time Capsule RX7 Original Owner (lady owned) from 1993-2014! Instant Modern Classic - One of the Most Iconic Japanese Sports Cars ever Produced Life-Long California Car - Garage Kept, Selectively Driven Records to New, Including Window Sticker, Original Invoice, Books, Keys More Impeccable 21,000 Mile Example Clean CarFax History Report One of the Finest Original Examples Extant Mazda's singular goal for the third and final-generation RX-7 was to create a pure sports car. Launched in 1993, this Mazda RX-7 was still a rear-wheel-drive two-door coupe, powered by a 1.3-liter twin-turbocharged rotary engine that put out 255 horsepower and 217 pound-feet of torque. The 1993-'95 RX-7 proved to be an impressive all-around performer. It was light, agile and fast. Zero-to-60 times were in the 5-second range. The suspension was tuned for the track, and the RX-7 came with many high-performance features, including a limited-slip differential, four-wheel antilock disc brakes and a five-speed manual transmission. More than a decade later, the last-generation Mazda RX-7 still holds up quite well when compared to more modern sports cars thanks to its exhilarating performance and beautiful styling. Of all the RX7s ever produced, the rarest species in existence is the Unmodified, Low Mileage, Garage Queen, California Sunday Driver. When it comes to this particular model, finding an example with all of those qualities is almost mythical. Well, here it is. Purchased new May 8, 1993 by a Mrs. Barr of Saratoga, California from nearby Sunnyvale Mazda, the car would remain under Mrs.Barr's ownership for the next 21 years selectively driven, protected under cover and always cherished. Vintage Red over Black upholstery, optional equipment includes: (KD) floor mats ($70.00), (01) California Emissions ($75.00) and the desired (I9) R1 Package ($1,500) with the addition of a factory shop manual - all verified by a copy of the original window sticker. In fact, ALL original purchase paperwork, Bill of Sale, Owners Manuals, warranty booklets, pre-Inspections and invoices accompany the car. Additionally included are all original sets of keys (with the spares still tagged by the dealer), front and rear license plate frames with original paper dealer tag and California plate (registration tags from 1993-20014 still adhered), car cover, articles and tech manuals. Today the RX7 remains in near mint new condition; all decals are in place, as well as the protective plastic still on the door sills. The Mazda has covered just about 21,000 miles in its lifetime and its condition reflects the meticulous care given throughout the years. We highly recommend this vehicle to the enthusiast collector who will continue to administer the level of preservation and enjoyment as Mrs. Barr did for this very special RX7. This modern classic has become one of the most Iconic Japanese sports cars ever produced and examples of this caliber are exceedingly rare - a closer inspection is encouraged. $37,500.00 To learn more about this vehicle, please contact our sales department at (281) 497-1000 or sales@driversource.com Selling Made Simple.

            "body": " Wagons remain red-hot in the marketplace, and what could be cooler than hauling your gear around in this sweet 1956 Chevrolet 210 station wagon? Classic looks and modern amenities make it easy to love, and a station wagon with a 4-speed manual gearbox is just too cool. Traditional 50s colors work just as well on a station wagon as they do on a flashy Bel Air convertible, and the Tahoe Turquoise and India Ivory combination here gives the wagon a bright look that disguises the modern upgrades underneath. The good news is that all the sheetmetal is in excellent shape with factory-grade gaps and that solid feeling only old cars seem to offer. The bad news is... well, there is no bad news other than to say this car works so well its been driven a bit since it was finished, so its not a show car anymore. Nevertheless, the chrome and stainless trim is very good, particularly the pieces that separate the two colors on the quarter panels, and its been fitted with new headlights and taillights. The fact that it has four doors doesnt make it any less cool than its Nomad siblings and its a lot more practical. Gray fabric makes the interior easy on the eyes and comfortable for long hauls, yet the contrasting turquoise dash and steering wheel keeps it looking like 1956. The important stuff is original, including the gauges, door hardware, and the gorgeous color-matched steering wheel. Beyond that, however, youll find aftermarket air conditioning neatly stashed under the dash, a Hurst shifter for the 4-speed manual gearbox, and seat belts for safety. A trio of auxiliary gauges has been installed under the dash to monitor oil pressure, temperature, and voltage, while the original AM radio still lives at center stage. The back seat is actually usable thanks to the 4-door design and the wonderful turquoise cargo bay is massive and expands exponentially with the fold-down rear seats. If you like your hot rods practical, this one delivers! With this 210, you also get a strong-running 283 cubic inch V8 engine, which, of course, looks right sitting in the engine bay. Its a little different than the original version, sporting a chrome air cleaner, fuelie double hump heads and a big Holley double-pumper up top and some trick valve covers with turquoise Chevrolet script on their faces. Theres also a big aluminum radiator and the A/C compressor, so theres no hiding the fact that this is a resto-mod built to drive. The Muncie 4-speed manual transmission was recently rebuilt and feeds a 10-bolt rear end hanging on original leaf springs. Power front disc brakes, a custom dual exhaust system, and a slightly lowered suspension are welcome additions that give it a hot rod attitude and easy road manners. The undercarriage is pretty original, so you shouldnt be afraid to drive this one, and the pretty chrome daisy mags with knock-offs are a vintage look that works rather well on this wagon. Recent 225/70/15 front and 235/70/15 rear Firestone radials finish the look. Documented with restoration receipts, this clean, ready-to-enjoy 210 wagon proves that practical can also be very cool.

            "body": " This 1963 Chevrolet Corvair Monza convertible represents more top-down fun for your dollar than just about anything else in our inventory. Where else are you going to find a car with an air-cooled flat-six, manual transmission, independent suspension, and room for four without it costing three times as much? Code 914 Monaco Blue is this cars original color, and it never looked better than it does here. The color is rich and sophisticated, and the use of modern urethane technology gives it an incredible shine thats hard to beat. Its not quite show quality, but for a $16,000 Corvair, it really looks good. The early Corvairs have a charm of their own, a unique style that didnt need to be anything other than what it was, and as a result, these cars stand out everywhere they go. The detailing is quite good, from the neat crease that encircles the entire body to the highly sculpted hood, to the louvered deck lid, theres something interesting everywhere you look. There are no body modifications, but the car somehow has an updated, more modern look that makes it seem more contemporary and disguises the economy car that lives inside. And even as a convertible, the doors fit well, panel alignment is good all around, and the car has a general look of having been loved. The handsome tan interior isnt what this one carried originally (it was blue-on-blue), but you cant argue with the look. The seats and door panels use authentic-looking patterns and materials and the combination has a timeless look that will never look dated. Almost everything inside the car is recent, and the darker brown carpets add an elegant look that really works well. Theres also a wood-rimmed steering wheel thats a little fatter than the original might have been, along with a chrome knob for the 4-speed manual gearbox. The instrument panel is from a Spyder and includes an accessory tachometer and aftermarket oil pressure gauge, all neatly situated in a silver gauge panel. A Pioneer AM/FM/CD stereo head unit is neatly installed under the dash so no cutting was required and the seats have extenders so the car is comfortable for longer-legged drivers. For weather protection, theres a recent black convertible top that stows under a matching tan boot for a clean look. The list of new equipment under the skin is extensive and starts with a 1965-vintage Corsa engine with four carburetors. The engine bay is incredibly sanitary with the engine down low and bright chrome air cleaner up high, and theres a fresh alternator to keep things charged up. A Crane Fireball ignition system lights the fires and theres a custom accelerator linkage to make it feel lively on the road. The 4-speed shifts well and really lets this engine work at its best, and its linked to the engine by a new clutch and pressure plate. Things like the suspension and U-joints are critical on Corvairs, so many of the components are new, ensuring that this one drives well and handles safely. Theres a new gas tank up front and a recent exhaust system out back, plus those great-looking Superlite wheels and 195/60/15 Goodyear radials. Corvairs represent huge bang for the buck and someone invested a lot of time and effort in this one to make it fun to drive yet still economical to own. Call today! STOCK/INV. NUMBER: 1098-DFW",

            "body": " The guys at Chevrolet know how to throw a party, and for the Corvettes 60th birthday, they brewed up this super cool anniversary model that mixes and matches the best components from the various Corvette models to create something truly special. And with just 1135 miles on the clock, this one is virtually new in every way and a must-have for any serious Corvette collector. You could probably call this anniversary Corvette a convertible Z06, since its got the Z06s carbon-fiber-enhanced bodywork, trick magnetic suspension, and thundering 7.0 liter V8. The look is definitely an upgrade over the base Vette and makes this anniversary model stand out among its distinguished peers. Its quite distinctive in its Arctic White paint with silver-blue stripes (note that the stripes continue on the convertible top, too!), and the voluptuous Z06 bodywork never looked better. Its got the splitter on the chin, brake cooling ducts on the quarters, and the somewhat subtle spoiler out back, all of which do more than look good. And with so few miles on the clock, everything remains in first-rate condition that looks like it just rolled out of the showroom. Unlike, say, the many pace cars that have rolled out of GM styling studios, this one is restrained and handsome, yet the unique look is far more distinctive than previous anniversary models. The anniversary models also received a bespoke blue leather interior thats as attractive as anything found in a European sports car costing thousands more. All the usual Corvette goodies are here, ranging from automatic climate control to power seats to a navigation system, so you wont have to give up any luxury to enjoy the towering performance. Like the exterior, the interior is factory-fresh with almost no signs of use, even on the leather seating surfaces. And looking around, you can see just how far the Corvette guys have come in upgrading the Corvettes interior, because every surface feels rich to the touch and the color is both consistent and subtle, so youll never get tired of being behind the wheel. Theres more Corvette goodness in the form of a slick-shifting 6-speed manual transmission, lightweight aluminum pedals, and a grippy steering wheel wrapped in suede, so it feels suitably racy. The aforementioned convertible top does sport fabric stripes of its own and stows in seconds under the hard-shell deck. The Z06s 7.0 liter V8 engine produces a staggering 505 horsepower and 470 pounds of torque, enough to humble even the most potent Corvettes of yore. The red coil covers give it away when you open the hood, and the list of special performance-enhancing components is impressive, including special valves in the mufflers that open up above 3000 RPM to totally transform the exhaust note from pleasant to front stretch at Le Mans! The magnetic shocks are pure magic, making this a high-performance Corvette thats comfortable enough for everyday driving and the giant brakes will keep you out of trouble unless you do something truly foolhardy. In fact, that sums up this anniversary Corvette perfectly: competent, fast, and extremely powerful, yet accessible. This is the pinnacle of C6 evolution and looks the part. Even the gorgeous wheels are artfully styled and wrapped in their original Michelin performance radials. As a collectors edition, this car comes fully documented with its original window sticker, manuals, and books, which will be increasingly critical in coming years. In the meantime, enjoy the meanest C6 convertible ever built. Call today! STOCK/INV. NUMBER: 1104-DFW",

            "body": " When car guys think of a Corvette, the C1 is typically what comes to mind as the ideal representation of the model. With iconic styling, a beautiful color combination, and a boosted performance delivered by a crate 350 V8, this Corvette is ready to be driven and enjoyed, or shown and admired. Yes, thats factory-correct, 1960 vintage code 509 Sateen Silver, and its absolutely gorgeous. Even the Ermine White side cove is the same stuff applied at the St. Louis factory in 1960. Together, they make for one of the most subtle and elegant of the Corvette color combinations. Parked among its peers, this car will stand out in a way that a lot of folks wont quite be able to grasp until they get up close and see that yes, there are a few blemishes here and there, but theres simply no beating that color choice. Obviously this car has always been babied over the decades and all the stainless and chrome trim is in terrific shape. Theres a light dusting of pitting on some of the cast pieces, but it would be a crime to consider re-plating any of the bright parts. As it sits today, this car has a wonderful all-of-a-piece look thats incredibly appealing. The black interior is also the same stuff that was installed at the factory, and todays reproduction seat covers just cant quite duplicate the level of detail the factory offered. The seats are still comfortable and supportive and theres not so much as a split seam or major scuff mark on any of the seating surfaces. Sure, theres a little stretching, but somehow that only makes it more appealing when you slide behind the big 3-spoke steering wheel. Once youre there, you get a great view of the gauges, which are all fully functional, including the tachometer, and the dash pad is remarkably well preserved. A 4-speed manual transmission with cue ball knob makes this Vette a joy to drive and while its not original, the AM/FM/cassette stereo head unit does make it a little more entertaining. Theres also a nice-fitting black convertible top thats a little faded and dry, but 100% intact and still usable in emergencies (which is the only time youre going to use the top anyway). The trunk mat is way too nice to be original, but it looks great. The 350 cubic inch V8 sadly, is not the original engine. We dont know when in the cars history it was replaced, but the story is that the owner was looking for more power than the original 283 could offer. Regardless, its a small block Chevy and with that in mind, the car has the right heart. Its dressed in period-correct gear like the finned valve covers, the generator with tachometer drive, and Chevy Orange paint, and they even went so far as to add a set of reproduction hoses and clamps. Replace the air cleaner and most folks wouldnt spot the engine swap, and the extra cubes do make for one fun cruiser. The 4-speed shifts well and the rest of the mechanics underneath are nicely preserved for their age and it exhales through a dual exhaust system that emits a proper V8 burble. Classic Coker wide whites give it the perfect look surrounding original hubcaps that are extremely nice. If this car had its original engine, it would cost at least twice as much. Instead, take advantage of this opportunity to enjoy an incredible C1 and still be able to drive it regularly without worries. Call today! STOCK/INV. NUMBER: 2371-ATL",

It is accented with Dover white stripes and looks fantastic with the white bucket seat interior. I has a real DZ block that was rebuilt and runs fantastic. Power from the solid lifter 302 V8 is smooth and sounds nasty through the factory style cambered exhaust. Of course it has the stripes, spoilers, F-41 suspension, 15 inch rally wheels, cowl induction hood, 12 bolt rear end, and Muncie 4-speed transmission as a Z-28 should. The body, paint, trim, and chrome are all very nice. The motor compartment and trunk compartments are clean and show well. We will replace the yellow wires with correct GM units to tidy it up a bit. The cowl hood is the real deal with the rear flapper doors to let the cool air into the functional air cleaner. Power front disc brakes and power steering are welcome options. Back to the interior it is extremely nice. It has the correct gauges, deluxe pedal trim, Hurst shifter, newer seat covers, door panels, carpet, and headliner. It also has a full set of seat belts. The chassis is clean and looks good with the aluminum exhaust and clean/smooth floor pans. This is an outstanding Z-28 that anyone would be proud to own. It turns heads and is a blast to drive.

It was marketed as a personal-luxury coupe through most of its history, with the last model version being classified as a full-sized couple. Through its many design changes it also endured a variety of mechanical, engine and safety advances. These cars have started to become very sought after and collectible. The Monte SS we are very pleased to offer here has had a minor exterior restoration with new paint. The interior is in excellent original condition and the drivetrain is a numbers matching 305 V8 that is stock. The brakes, shocks, springs and suspension busings have all been upgraded for handling and driveability, not to mention a much more aggressive stance. Accompanying this car is the original bill-of-sale, owners manual, window sticker and dealer info book. This is car starts, runs and drives very well and is ready to be enjoyed.

            "body": " This 1950 Ford F-1 pickup is one of those awesome vehicles we get in from time to time, you know, the one that you always wanted and didnt think you could afford to buy or build. Well, strap in, because this one is remarkably affordable and beautifully built. The Ford F-1 is arguably the best-looking post-war truck, and theres just about nothing you can do to make them unattractive. Fortunately, all the right stuff is here: beautiful burgundy paint, all the original trim has been neatly re-chromed, and theres a neatly finished wood bed out back. Those fat fenders have been sanded and blocked to make them smoother than new, that big clamshell hood fits well, and even the original running boards have been retained. The paint looks good, but it isnt like those trailer queens you see, so you wont be afraid to drive it every chance you get, which really is the reason for owning a truck like this. In fact, this one has been a regular on the Hot Rod Power Tour, so you know its well sorted and an excellent driver. And for long cruises, that rosewood bed is also fitted with a full-sized spare and a diamond-plate tool box for weather-tight storage. The interior has been thoughtfully updated but doesnt lose its 50s character. Theres still a bench seat, but the soft gray and burgundy tweed is a lot more comfortable than the original vinyl, and there are matching carpets in place of the factory rubber mat. The original gauge cluster has been replaced by a custom woodgrained insert full of Auto Meter Pro-Comp gauges and theres a matching glove box door to warm things up inside. This truck also comes complete with ice-cold A/C, which is always a nice upgrade for any rod, as well as a great-sounding AM/FM/CD stereo system. A tilt column with custom wood-rimmed steering wheel matches the dash and the door panels are simple pieces that emphasize the trucks utilitarian roots. Its comfortable, stylish, and easy to drive, just the way you would have done it if you were doing it for yourself, right? Theres a 350 cubic inch Chevrolet V8 under the hood doing a great job of moving the vintage truck and offers a great soundtrack. Its neatly dressed with Chevrolet-logo valve covers and a chrome air cleaner, and the aluminum heads ensure that its plenty potent out on the road. The front clip is from a Camaro, offering an independent suspension, power steering and front disc brakes, and that same F-body gave up its 10-bolt rear end 3.73 gears inside. With a 700R4 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission, this truck cruises effortlessly at modern highway speeds, and its easy to see why it was a favorite Power Tour participant. A great-sounding dual exhaust system has been neatly tucked out of sight and uses glasspack-style mufflers for an old-school burble at idle and a fantastic roar when you stand on it. Classic Torque Thrust wheels complete the vintage look and carry 235/60/15 front and 275/60/15 rear blackwall radials. Look at the pictures of this awesome Ford, then take another look at the price. Dont wait too long, because bargains like this dont come along very often. Call today! STOCK/INV. NUMBER: 1097-DFW",

            "body": " After years of living behind their 60s counterparts, the collectors are really starting to take notice of the 71-73 Mustangs. And when you look at examples like this 72 Mustang convertible, it makes you wonder why they remained the best kept secret of Mustang aficionados until recently. This is an all around its an amazing car that is ready for that sunny Sunday cruise. Having been painted in May of 2012, the body features a fresh coat of white with the addition of Mach 1 black stripes that run the length of the body. Youll notice right away that the top is in fantastic shape as it was replaced in 2012 also. The paint is nice but not perfect, however, it does have the important stuff right, adding a chin spoiler, twin black hood stripes, and a wing on the trunk lid, made for one heck of a good-looking Mustang! The chrome is in great shape and really accentuates the overall look of the car. You wont be disappointed when you roll this beauty where it deserves to be, out into the sun. It is quite possible that the interior is entirely original, and with high-back bucket seats, its still a great place to do some serious driving. The blue upholstery does show a some age, but nothing that you wouldnt expect to find in a classic car, and it still shows really nicely. A center console dresses up the shifter so its not just sticking out of the transmission tunnel, and what are believed to be the original set of blue floor mats compliment the steering wheel wrap. The dash radio bezel has been replaced and you now find an upgraded AM/FM radio system. The carpet is in fantastic shape, and the trunk is outfitted with a space-saver spare. Add in features like working air conditioning, power steering, power brakes and a power convertible top, and you have an incredible place to log miles from. Pop the hood and youll be hit by the famous FoMoCo Blue, covering a 302ci 2V V8. While we know the engine isnt original, you would never know it as everything in the satin black engine bay appears the way it left the factory. You wont find any structural issues on the shock towers that are common on these early 70s mustangs. A recent freshening of the engine saw the addition of a new fuel pump, voltage regulator, exhaust, battery, alternator, and even front wheel bearings. Bolted to the engine is an automatic transmission that is ready for highway cruising. Stopping power comes courtesy of power brakes that sit behind 14 Magnum 500 wheels, wrapped in 205/75R14 redline rubber. This is a great time to grab an affordable early 70s Mustang because they are primed to only go up in value from here. This slick convertible pony car has a lot going for it, most notably a very attractive price. Call today! STOCK/INV. NUMBER: 2836-CHA",

There are only a hand full of these extremely rare Thunderbirds left in the world. Even rarer, this 1957 Ford Thunderbird E-Type is largely original. The numbers are one hundred percent correct, and it still wears the original factory Rose paint and factory interior. The Thunderbird is equipped with the legendary 312 C.I. V8 engine, 2 4bbl carburetors (producing 275 HP at 5,000 RPM), and three speed automatic transmission. This particular 1957 Ford T Bird was a national show winner in 1993 and was shortly thereafter retired to a private collection. It has been driven sparingly and has been well maintained. It comes with a hard top and a convertible top. This is an excellent Thunderbird. Thunderbird enthusiasts love this rare find! STOCK/INV. NUMBER: 50117",

Widely known as one of the most popular collector cars of the classic car era, the 1966 Mustang is and has been a great buy. This particular one was upgraded with a 302 4V engine, which looks identical to the original 289, but delivers increased horsepower and performance and is mated with a C4 automatic. Power steering is included, but the Mustang does not come with power brakes. However, power brakes can be added at a reasonable price. This Mustang coupe has been well maintained and has brand new front shocks, carburetor, spark plugs, wires, distributor, fuel pump, radiator, fuel gauge, sending unit, trunk lock, tires, wheel bearings, grease caps, seals and more. Mechanically and structurally, it is a solid car. The original black interior is in good shape and the exterior is also in good shape, though the red paint roof has minor peeling. Aftermarket wheels and LeMans stripes give it a more aggressive look than you would find on a typical 66 Mustang coupe. Give us a call to find out more about this well maintained classic car!

This 67 Mustang coupe was originally a C code, 2 bbl, 289 automatic but has since been rebuilt and modified. It is now bored to 302 C. I. with a 4 bbl carb, 4 speed toploader transmission, and aftermarket air conditioning. Flowmaster mufflers give it a throaty exhaust note and make it sound like a Mustang should. It runs and drives well. The clutch engages properly and shows no signs of slipping. Minor throw-out bearing noise can be detected which does not affect performance. Aftermarket wheels add to the appearance. Paint is a 30 footer, meaning it looks good going down the street, but shows cracks on the deck lid and a few other spots. Interior is clean but upholstery needs to be replaced. There is no structural rust. While it runs and drives as it sits, it is a great prospect for a do-it-yourself project. It located in Las Vegas.

            "body": " This 1965 Mustang restomod may look like a street monster, and we guess it qualifies, but as monstrous as this classic Mustang convertible is, it was designed to be a weekend toy with excellent street manners. While the Mustang comes with a bored/stroked 427 C. I. 500 HP Windsor engine block and a highly modified C4 automatic transmission, its docile enough to be used as a parade car. Many parades often use classic convertible Mustangs for transporting parade officials and this one has been sparingly used for that purpose since its full three year restoration. The Mustang is even designed with a parade seat, which will accommodate three beauty queens comfortably. Just think of that sight in your rear view mirror or even viewing a proud Mustang photo keepsake! This 1965 Mustang Convertible has had a complete body off restoration and customization. The rear end has been tubbed which eliminates the back seat. The parade seat rests on the roll cage, a perfect perch for occupants to wave at the crowds. The rear tires are massive, and the rear wheel well opening has been extended. It looks stock and by extending it 4 the look is very clean. The floors were replaced and a complete frame was added from the rear bumper to the front for stability, control and safety. The 427 C. I. Windsor engine features Twisted wedge heads ported and polished. The intake valves are 2.08 and the exhaust valves are 1.64. This 68 Mustang comes with Fel Pro wire lock head gaskets, matched Eagle connecting rods and Clevite bearings, custom Stroker crank, Probe flat top pistons, Billett balancer, MSD 6AL digital ignition and distributor, 8 qt oil pan, Victor junior intake manifold, a Holley 850 double pumper, Block hugger Headman headers reworked to fit the Twisted wedge heads, a four row aluminum radiator, a custom Flowmaster stage 2 exhaust, Cragar wheels 4 in front and 15 X 15 in rear with 18.5 X 31 Mickey Thompson extra soft rears, a 15 gallon foam filled aluminum fuel tank, Holley Blue continuous circulating fuel pump, and an exterior mounted kill switch for all the electrical components. The motor mounts directly on the sub frame and is rock solid. There is no torque flex on the shock towers or fender aprons. This is a GREAT fun car that can be driven daily or just for occasions. If youre looking for a one-of-a-kind classic convertible Mustang weekend head turner, this is it! Check out these great classic Mustang photos! STOCK/INV. NUMBER: 50152",

Fully restored at Gateway Classic Mustang by Lonny Jason Childress for their Dad, Dale Childress. In short, it was done right! Nicely optioned, the red exterior paint is flawless. Matched with a white interior and white convertible top boot (black convertible top), this 70 Convertible is a show winner. It was honored with the runner up trophy at the 32nd Annual Mid-America Ford Performance and Shelby meet in Tulsa, OK in 2006. It has been stored in a temperature controlled environment since restoration. Its as close to perfect as youll find. The attention to detail was over the top. For example the original voltage regulator was modified with a solid state regulator, but recovered it with the original cover. Equipment includes a internally modified 302 V8. It was originally a 2 bbl 302, but has been rebuilt with a competition cam, and a 650 4 bbl and Edelbrock intake, and ceramic coated exhaust manifolds, but maintains the correct appearance for the car. The powerful 302 engine is mated with a C4 automatic transmission, power steering, power brakes, air conditioning, AM/FM radio, console, and power top. It was equipped from the factory with every available option in 1970. A tach and volt meter have been neatly installed as aftermarket items in front of the shifter, much like Shelby gauges in the 70 GT500. Magnum 500 wheels were a factory option in 1970, and this car has a new set. Destined to appreciate, this is a terrific opportunity to own a stunning 70 Mustang that is in better than showroom condition. This one is located in the St. Louis, MO area. STOCK/INV.

The 68 Mustang comes in the original factory Tahoe Turquois exterior paint with black interior, 289 C. I. engine, C4 automatic transmission, power steering, AM radio and console. There were a few minor upgrades applied to this 1968 Mustang Coupe after production. The factory air conditioning has been upgraded to R134 Freon, it still works great. The factory exhausts were also replaced, with Flowmasters. This is a true survivor vintage car in original condition. The overall condition is very good and the upholstery is clean and original. The only flaw is a small 1/2 tear in the headliner. This 68 Mustang would make a great weekend driver. The service records and the original owners manual go with the car. It is located in California.

            "body": " This is a nice driving 1965 Ford Thunderbird that needs a new owner. First, mechanically this car runs and drives nicely, it starts immediately, does not overheat, and most things work well. Shift it into gear and off you go, we have driven this car over an hour and it ran perfectly. Some small issues, the windows are power and currently do not operated, It has a small exhaust leak at the manifold (very common in these cars), and it needs a minor amount of brake work. We can address all of these minor issues for the new owner. The interior is in good condition overall with only a couple of minor issues. The red leather still feels good, the dash, steering wheel, door panels, and carpets all look good as well. The headliner will need to be cleaned, it is in good condition. The body on this car is in very good condition overall with original floor pans and almost no rust. The right side floor pan has some surface rust and the trunk pan also has some surface rust but other than these minor issues that can be addressed at some point in the future. Maybe this winter or some time in the next 5-10 years. In short, this is a great driving and good looking 1965 Thunderbird that runs, drives, has a nice interior, and is ready to enjoy!

I am selling this car as a package deal which includes the Blue 1960 Dodge Matador 4 DR sedan which is included in the group of photos with the White D500 car. The Matador is also a very solid, salt and chemical free Montana car. The two car package will give most all the necessary parts to restore the D500 car, which can include the long ram intake but no carbs, air cleaners, or long ram exhaust manifolds. I have another crate of parts that will go with the package deal that includes glass and roof and glass trim. I would like to visit with you by phone if you are a serious buyer for these cars and we can go over the inventory of what I have to put into the package and the prices.
