            "body": "This 1972 Cougar is one really nice example of these fine cars and Mercurys contribution to the pony car market. Fitted with Mercurys European-influenced styling, this coupe really differentiates itself from the other cars of this era. Like many highly option Mustangs, though, this Cougar came from the factory with the potent 351cid V8. Its fun on the road, great to look at, easy to work on, and surprisingly comfortable, and enjoyable to drive. The body of the car is very good condition, the pans, rockers, and frame are really in good shape. For us, this car is all about style. Its not the fastest or loudest pony car, but its got the iconic electric razor grill, the cool headlights and the burble and power from the 351 V8. The color combination is vintage 70's, and this car is a combination of Mustang and Grand Torino. The interior is in very good to excellent. The black bucket seats are comfortable and sporty, and the center console adds gives the car a grand tourer feel. The headliner and dash are in great shape, too. Underneath, the car is in very good to excellent, the floor pans are original, and there is no rot or rust. The torque boxes are in good shape, too. The rocker panels are very clean. Its a clean, fun example that you can drive as is and simply enjoy for short money. With so many Mustangs and Camaros on the road, its nice to roll into cruise night in something a little unique, stretch that dollar for enjoyment! If you want to know the reserve or Buy it now please CALL US at (603) 818-8511. For more information please ask for Brandon or Josh.

            "body": "This is a fully sorted and fully restored 1963 Mercury Marauder Hardtop in excellent Black Paint with an excellent Red Interior. This is a great example of Mercury styling of the early 60's, the iconic big block 390 Cubic Inch V8, an excellent color combination, great paint, great mechanicals, a great body, and a great sounding exhaust, this car is the real deal. This is a very clean and straight example that has clearly been well cared for over the years. The body is in excellent shape, with no rust, no bubbles, and nicely done professional paint. The paint looks great and makes the car look like new, and it sure feels that way going down the road. This car shows very well and will trophy at many cars shows right now, the Black Paint complements the Red interior nicely. All the glass is very good and the chrome trim is also all in very good to excellent condition. The interior is stunning. The seats are in excellent shape, as are the door panels, the dash is great, the headliner is tight and clean, and it even smells like new. The drivers seat is a beautiful place to sit and pilot this gorgeous antique. The rugs, and all of the touchables are also in excellent condition, simply drive the car. We were very impressed with the condition of the car underneath. The floors, frame rails and rocker panels are all excellent with no rot, rust, or issues. We found no evidence of accident history or previous repair underneath. This is a highly original, solid car, making it a great candidate for long-term investment and enjoyment. Its great on the road, too; a smooth driver with plenty of power and torque to keep up with todays traffic while getting all the looks and waves. The tires are almost new and the rims are a great finish to this classic car. My advice is buy this car before the owner decides to keep it. The more he drives it, the more he loves it. If you are interested in the reserve on this car, CALL ME - (603) 818-8511 >",

No, but a very good and incredibly cool car that is rust free, fully restored, and ready to enjoy. The look of the rear window (WOW!), the no post look and swept back lines of the windows, the front lines are nicely swept, and the tail is what sells this car. The body is simply sexy and sleek. This car starts immediately, drives nicely, stops nicely, and has a nice running 318 V8 that purrs like a kitten. Start it up, shift it nicely into gear with the console shifter, and off you go to the nearest car show. The exhaust note is just perfect with just a nice touch of rumble and you can win now at the show. The paint looks very good and is in very good quality, it is not a concourse winner but will et you many trophy's at many regional shows. The paint shines nicely, the colors are sharp, and she looks fantastic. The glass is all in good shape, particularly the incredibly shaped rear glass. The windshield is brand new as well. No other cracks or issues. The most pleasantly supervising part of this car is the underneath, it is rust free and in excellent condition. It is in really good shape with no rust or rot. The overall structure of the car is excellent, no frame rust, the front pans, rockers, and other areas look very good. Bid, Buy, Enjoy!

            "body": "This 1965 Plymouth Barracuda is a cruising machine and in very good overall condition! Can you drive it now and enjoy it? Yes sir, it is ready for the open road! New paint, tires, tune up, great interior (a couple of minor issues), rugs are excellent, and she runs and drives like she came from the factory! This Barracuda is all original and has the 273 Commando V8 with an original factory 4 Speed Stick! It is perfect? No, but a very good and incredibly cool car that is ready to enjoy. The look of the rear window (WOW!), the no post look and swept back lines of the windows, the front lines are nicely swept, and the tail is what sells this car. The body is simply sexy and sleek. This car starts immediately, drives nicely, stops nicely, and has a nice running 273 V8 that purrs like a kitten. Start it up, shift it nicely into gear with the 4 Speed Stick, and off you go to the nearest car show. The exhaust note is just perfect with just a nice touch of rumble and you can win now at the show. The paint looks very good and is in very good quality, it is not a concourse winner but you can likely win trophy's at many regional shows. The paint shines nicely, the colors are sharp, and she looks fantastic. The glass is all in good shape, particularly the incredibly shaped rear glass. The windshield is in good shape as well. The most pleasantly supervising part of this car is the underneath, it is in great shape. Some professional work has been done, but she looks good. The overall structure of the car is very good, the pans, rockers, and other areas also look very good. Bid, Buy, Enjoy! If you want to know the reserve or Buy it now please CALL US at (603) 818-8511. For more information please ask for Brandon or Josh. After business hours the line is always forwarded to one of our personal phones. CALL US (603) 818-8511 If you would like to see the car in person, please call 24 hours in advance to>",

These cars are nothing short of incredible to drive and enjoy they float down the road and make a Smart Car look downright silly. It is a large car with a fully automated convertible top that is simply built to enjoy. Take the whole family or friends on a trip down memory lane or out for ice cream! It runs, drives, shifts, the windows wipers, lights, horn, signals, all work. It is ready to enjoy. The body is in overall very good condition underneath, rockers and pans are very good, and the car is in its original color and it looks terrific. There are the usual small issues that are an easy fix, these are nits and nats, but that is all. Please see the extensive pictures. The interior on the car is all leather and in very good condition as is the dash, carpets, headliner on the top, and door panels. The touchables are all in very good condition. The car starts immediately, runs nicely, idles nicely, and most of the major systems function as intended. With all cars that are 40+ years old there are some minor issues. There are other small nits and nats that will need to be addressed as part of the ongoing maintenance of the car. We know these cars well and will fix these issues for the new owner as directed. The AC will need a rebuild or a charge, but the blower motor does work well. Bid, Buy, and Enjoy! Otherwise you will wish that you had.",

This is a very good running and driving example of these cars, though it does have a minor rear main seal leak that will need to be fixed. We are happy to do this work or you can take her as is and do it yourself. Overall the car is a good one, with a good undercarriage (it was a Western States car for most of its life), it has a very nice interior that, and is a very eye pleasing White on Black. The mechanicals on this car are very good, with the exception of the rear seal issue, the moment it came to our shop you had to stand in line to take her for a ride. She starts right up and idles nicely, ease the shifter to put it into gear and off you go down the road. The transmission shifts nicely and the brakes work well. Overall the major systems function as they should and the engine sounds great. The AC is not currently working. The interior on this car is in very good condition and looks great. The seats are comfortable to sit in and in very good condition. The carpet is in good condition as is the dash, the steering wheel, and the headliner. The touchable items are all in very good condition and feel good. The body on this car is in overall very good condition, the frame, the pans, the trunk, the rockers are all very clean. Overall this car is in very good shape and you could easily use her as a daily once the issue is resolved. Just drive it and look good while you are doing it! Bid, Buy, Enjoy! Drive it! If you want to know the reserve or Buy it now please CALL US at (603) 8>",

This is a reasonably clean and straight example that has clearly been well cared for over the years. The car runs and drives and most things work including the windows.

All the glass is intact, and the chrome trim is in good shape as well. This is a no post car, so put down the windows and let the cruising begin, this car has a great chassis for enjoying the wind in your hair while sitting on a SUPER Comfy seats. Don't forget, this is a Cadillac! The interior is in good overall condition with some minor issues. The seats, door panels, the dash and the headliner are all in good condition. It's a very cool and truly time simplified cabin that has one purpose to drive down the road, no distraction with buzzers and bells. The headliner and all of the touchables are also in good condition, simply drive the car. We were very impressed with the condition of the car underneath. The floors, frame rails and rocker panels are in great shape. This is a highly original, solid car, making it a great candidate for long-term investment and enjoyment, but as with all antique cars there are nits and nats. Its great on the road, too; a smooth driver with plenty of power and torque to keep up with todays traffic while getting all the looks and waves. The more>",

She runs and drives like a brand new car, everything works, and on a recent trip out for lunch we made lots of new friends. Everyone wants to take it for the weekend and enjoy the admiration and thumbs up that come with driving this great car. She starts right up and idles nicely, ease the shifter to put it into gear and off you go down the road, head to California if you want. The transmission shifts nicely and the brakes work well. Overall the major systems function as they should and the engine sounds great. The AC is not currently working. The interior on this car is in very good condition and looks great. The seats are comfortable to sit in and in very good condition. The carpet is in very good condition as is the dash, the steering wheel, and the headliner. The touchable items are all in very good condition and feel good. The body on this car is in overall very good condition. The frame, the pans, the trunk, the rockers are all very clean.

            "body": "Featuring a modern GM drivetrain, immaculate body and paintwork, and an interior that'll make most late model luxury cars feel wholly inadequate, this freshly minted Willys is virtually guaranteed to be a trophy winner! The car's smooth, fiberglass body was created by the experts at Outlaw Performance in Avonmore, Pennsylvania. During its detailed, 2014 completion, that shaved resin was fitted with a stainless grille, custom Mini headlamps, a custom 'fresh air' hood, stainless windshield wipers, smoked glass, body-matched mirrors, flush-fit tail lamps and a folding tag bracket. And everything was finished with a glowing coat of Pearl Orange 2-stage that's been buffed and sanded to a spectacular shine. Clocking in at exactly six liters, or 364 cubic inches, the car's buff small block twists stout 10.9 to 1 compression into an even 400 horsepower and 400 lb./ft. of torque. Behind that engine, a painted and chrome-clad 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission powers a Currie 9-inch rear end. In front of that drivetrain, a Mustang II-style suspension wraps Ridetech air ride components in polished, tubular control arms. Behind that drivetrain, a custom 4-link suspension makes good use of more Ridetech components. Flaming River rack-and-pinion steering provides excellent feedback on the road. Stops come courtesy of four polished calipers and four drilled and slotted rotors. And chrome Foose wheels spin 215/35ZR18 BF Goodrich g-Force T/As in front of 285/35ZR22 BF Goodrich g-Force T/As. Like most ground-up builds, this Willys features a completely custom interior. Classic Auto air conditioning offers refreshing reprieve from hot summer car shows. And a premium Alpine audio system makes good use of quality Ron Francis wiring. With head-turning looks, a powerplant worthy of any drag strip and build quality that'll make you appreciate every detail time and time again, this pearlescent pavement pounder is an incredible build.

This car is truly simplistic and enjoyable, everything you want in a Classic Car. This is a reasonably clean and straight example that has clearly been well cared for over the years. The car runs and drives nicely, simply start her up and off you go. The body is also in good shape, with some minor rust on the undercarriage and in some of the body panels. There are some nits and nats, minor dents and some flaky paint, but all are minor and easily repairable and they do not take much away from the elegance and presence of this classically styled sedan. All the glass is intact, and the chrome trim is in good shape as well. The interior is in good overall condition with some minor issues with the front seat, this is an easy fix and the car runs and drives very nicely. The door panels, the dash and the headliner are all in very good condition with one exception. It's a very cool and truly time simplified cabin that has one purpose to drive down the road, no distraction with buzzers and bells. The headliner, rugs, and all of the touchables are also in good condition, simply drive the car. We were very impressed with the condition of the car underneath. The floors, frame rails and rocker panels are in great shape, there are a couple of spots that need attention, but these are an easy fix. This is a highly original, solid car, making it a great candidate for long-term investment and enjoyment. Its great on the road, too; a smooth driver with plenty of power and torque to keep up with todays traffic while getting all the looks and waves. The more we drive it, the more we love to drive it.

Overall the major systems function as they should. The interior on this car is in very good condition. The seats are comfortable to sit in and in very good condition. The carpet is in good shape, the dash has no cracks, but the steering wheel is also very good and leather wrapped three spoke. The headliner, and touchable items are all in very good condition and feel good. The body on this car is in very good condition, the paint shines nicely, but she does have some minor nits and nats. This car is a great driver, looks nice, interior is in very good shape, and would be a great inexpensive daily vintage car. Overall good vintage car with Iconic good looks, good mechanicals, great interior, all in all a great daily vintage driver! Bid, Buy, Enjoy! Drive it and work on it, this is what we do best!

This car is truly simplistic and enjoyable, everything you want in a Classic Car. This is a reasonably clean and straight example that has clearly been well cared for over the years. The car runs and drives nicely, simply start her up and off you go. The body is also in good shape, with some minor rust on the undercarriage and in some of the body panels. There are some nits and nats, minor dents and some flaky paint, but all are minor and easily repairable and they do not take much away from the elegance and presence of this classically styled sedan. All the glass is intact, and the chrome trim is in good shape as well. The interior is in good overall condition with some minor issues with the front seat, this is an easy fix and the car runs and drives very nicely. The door panels, the dash and the headliner are all in very good condition with one exception. It's a very cool and truly time simplified cabin that has one purpose to drive down the road, no distraction with buzzers and bells. The headliner, rugs, and all of the touchables are also in good condition, simply drive the car. We were very impressed with the condition of the car underneath. The floors, frame rails and rocker panels are in great shape, there are a couple of spots that need attention, but these are an easy fix. This is a highly original, solid car, making it a great candidate for long-term investment and enjoyment. Its great on the road, too; a smooth driver with plenty of power and torque to keep up with todays traffic while getting all the looks and waves. The more we drive it, the more we love to drive it.

It has a good body with min. rust or rot, couple of rocker issues, and the normal spare tire issue, these are minor 2. It has brand new seats, a good dash, steering wheel, headliner, etc. Door panels need a recover. 3. It runs and drives great, starts right up, idles nicely and it sounds great. 4. The chrome bumpers and overall chrome is in very good condition as is the glass. For the reserve price on this car it would be near impossible to duplicate this car, that is to find a rusty one and try to restore it. This car is complete, running, but it needs to be taken to the next level in terms of restoration. Keep it original, we hope you do this, for the love of these cars. The mechanicals of this car are very good and we believe that all she has is the original 61,700 miles and that this car has lived a protected life, though it does need paint. This car is 73 years old and still runs and drives, you can' t fake or duplicate the way this car feels when you drive it. it has the original Straight 8, and is a matching numbers car. The interior is in overall good condition and it would take minimal work to take it to the next level. The seats are brand new, just installed, the trim is in good condition and complete, all of the glass is great. Overall the interior feels good and you can't help but smile a big grin driving her to get a gallon of milk! Yes, it does need door panels and some dash resto work, but this is easy work.

This car has a great look and runs and drives, take your friends and family for a trip down memory lane in this comfortable and good looking Electra. She feels like a coupe! Overall this car is in good condition, it runs, shifts, starts immediately, and has a nice interior and is a later design to the original Astro Drive console of the late 50's and early 60's, but it has a very unique tilting display that includes the speedometer. This car has room for the kids, grandkids, or another couple for a nice cruise in the country. The mechanicals are good, engine runs, starts without a hiccup, and shifts into gear, most of the major systems function as they should. The body is in good shape, minor surface rust in a couple of spots and some other nits and nats and the normal minor issues that these cars have after 53+ years. See the pictures of the frame, pans, rockers, and overall body. It feels solid, and will serve its next owner well.

            "body": "The Monte Carlo is a two-door coupe which was produced by Chevrolet through six generations from 1970-2007. It was marketed as a personal-luxury coupe through most of its history, with the last model version being classified as a full-sized couple. Through its many design changes it also endured a variety of mechanical, engine and safety advances. These cars have started to become very sought after and collectible. The Monte SS we are very pleased to offer here has had a minor exterior restoration with new paint. The interior is in excellent original condition and the drivetrain is a numbers matching 305 V8 that is stock. The brakes, shocks, springs and suspension busings have all been upgraded for handling and driveability, not to mention a much more aggressive stance. Accompanying this car is the original bill-of-sale, owners manual, window sticker and dealer info book. This is car starts, runs and drives very well and is ready to be enjoyed.

With only sunny summer miles on a complete, body-off reboot, this mean C2 drop-top is a super clean show car that puts the p, r and o in \"trophy\". During its professional restoration, the car's solid, fiberglass body was thoroughly massaged to correct all the typical waves and ripples that came standard from GM's St. Louis manufacturing facility.

And finally, everything was layered in a smooth red basecoat, sealed in a glossy clearcoat and buffed to a fantastic shine. In the auto enthusiast world, there are few bigger faux pas than a car that promises performance but doesn't deliver. \"It looks fast\" just doesn't cut it with real car guys, so the old school Chevrolet iron block that used to power this Corvette has been put out to pasture. In its place you'll find a fully detailed Bill Mitchell Racing Hardcore 427 that pushes roughly 500 horsepower to the car's big rear wheels. Behind that raucous engine, a stout Richmond 5-speed spins power through a fresh driveshaft that's married to a completely rebuilt rear end. Stops are provided by red Wilwood calipers, 6-piston units up front and 4-piston units out back, which squeeze 14 inch drilled and slotted rotors. Turns come courtesy of a fresh power rack and pinion system that, when combined with the car's upgraded control arms, provides a modern feel and great performance. And power flows to the pavement through aggressive Schott Mod 5 eXLs that spin 245/35ZR18 BF Goodrich G-Force T/As in front of 285/35ZR19 BF Goodrich G-Force T/As.

Everything else, steering wheel is from a 442, headliner, and especially the dash is in really good shape. This car is ready to enjoy, simply get in and drive, it had been used as a daily driver. The underside of this car is in overall good condition, the frame, body mounts, pans, and cross members are in very good condition. The rear quarters and a couple of panels have some minor issues that are an easy fix, but you can drive it right now.

This car does have th 442 badging, but it is a tribute car that has its original 350 Cubic Inch V8 mated to a three speed Turbo 350 that starts right up and runs and drives great. Nice cruising combination that runs great, looks great, and sounds great. This is a good running and driving example of these cars with a very clean undercarriage, nice interior, and very nice running and driving engine and transmission. The mechanicals on this car are very good, the moment it came to our shop you had to stand in line to take her for a ride. Everyone wants to take it for the weekend and enjoy the admiration and thumbs up that come with driving this great car. She starts right up and idles nicely, ease the shifter to put it into gear and off you go down the road. The transmission shifts nicely and the brakes work well. Overall the major systems function as they should. The interior on this car is in very good to excellent condition. The seats are comfortable to sit in and in very good condition, there are a couple of small issues, but these are an easy fix. The carpet is in good shape, the dash has no cracks, and the steering wheel is also very good. The touchable items are all in very good condition and feel good. The body on this car is in overall very good to excellent condition. The frame, the pans, the rockers are all very clean. There is one issue at the base of the passenger side rear quarter that needs to be addresses at some point in the future, but this is an easy fix. Overall this car is in very good shape, with only the minor nicks that come with time. The paint is good driver quality, and it shines nicely. Just drive it and look good while you are doing it! Bid, Buy, Enjoy! Drive it! If you want to know the reserve or Buy it now please CALL US at (603) 818-8511.",

            "body": "1979 Datsun 280ZX For Sale in Mountain Home, Arkansas 72653 This 1979 Datsun 280ZX (by Nissan) is, essentially, a one-owner vehicle. The car was bought new by the original owner and (to the best of my knowledge) has spent its entire life in Arkansas. I have spoken to several local people who knew the original owner. In fact, I have a good friend who worked with the original owner when he bought the car new in '79. All have confirmed that the man loved this car, and the condition of the car confirms as much. There is only one aesthetic flaw worthy of mention, and that is a crack in the middle of the dash cover - See pic. Otherwise, the car is in exceptional condition, as the pictures show - no rust, no dings, no scratches - truly in like new condition inside and out! Exceptional repaint using factory colors and factory paint scheme - silver on blue - done so well, in fact, that I had owned the car for some time before I realized it had been repainted after discovering some overspray on the old muffler. With the old muffler no longer on the car, a trained professional would need some time to confirm that the paint isn't original. The car sat in a shop building for several years (an oil change sticker on the windshield was dated 2001 and, at least in part, explains the low mileage) and would not run when I purchased it. Everything appeared to be in good order, but the car would flood immediately. The issue was the ECM (Electronic Control Module). It pin tested fine on the bench, but was holding all six injectors wide open - a condition that a bench pin test won't reveal and the least likely of culprits. I suspect the original owner just gave up, parked it in his shop and threw a cover over it. Given the age of the car and the fact that it had sat for several years, a thorough rehabilitation was in need, and has been completed over the course of some 1,500 miles of me driving it and a small team of professional mechanics working out all of the kinks. Aside from being in excellent condition, I think the time, care and money put into making the car roadworthy again is what sets this 280ZX apart from most all of the others you see on the internet. Very, very few are as nice as this one. Even fewer are as drive-able. This one runs and drives like it must have when new. Features/Options: 2-Seater (not the 2+2), 5 Speed Manual, Cruise, PW (auto up/down on driver's side), Power Mirrors, Rear Window Defrost, Factory Radio, Factory Eight Track Tape, Factory Amplifier, Power Antenna, Aftermarket Headlight Lens Covers, Aftermarket rocker panel covers and front lower cowl/air scoop, all in like new condition. A few components new to this care are, as follows: 1) Fuel Tank/System drained/cleaned; 2) Fuel Injectors - (6), including cold start inj. (w/ new individual fuel lines and electrical plugs; 3) Fuel Pressure Regulator, Fuel Filter; 4) Plugs, Plug Wires, Ignition Coil; 5) Alternator, Battery; 6) A/C Compressor, Evaporator/Drier, R-134 conversion; 7) Vacuum tubes, Various Sensors; 8) Struts and Springs - front and rear; 9) Strut Rod bushings; 10) Sway Bar End-Link bushings; 11) Full brake job (ceramic pads front and rear), including brake hoses; 12) Radiator and heater hoses; 13) Tires; 14) Muffler/Tail Pipe; 15) Carpet kit w/ custom, color-matching ZX floor mats. Always garaged and covered. It is a must see and drive because you won't find another one owner matching numbers ZX in this condition for the price i'm asking!

Under the hood you will find a beautiful LS1 that was painted to match the truck along with the rest of the engine bay. The exhaust is run through a set of shorty headers out to a dual Borla exhaust system then dumps out to a single exhaust tip out the back and sounds absolutely amazing. Options on this 1955 Ford F100 for sale include: Air Conditioning, AM/FM Radio with CD Player, Power Brakes, Power Steering, Power Windows, Seat Belts, Tilt and Telescopic Wheel, Leather Interior, Aluminum Alloy Wheels, and Radial Tires.

Finishing off the custom look and killer stance are a set of polished aluminum alloy Boyd Coddington wheels measuring 18\" in the front and 20\" in the rear. This is one awesome '55 F100 that will sure to win you trophies as it has won over a 100 in the past two years alone!

It is accented with Dover white stripes and looks fantastic with the white bucket seat interior. I has a real DZ block that was rebuilt and runs fantastic. Power from the solid lifter 302 V8 is smooth and sounds nasty through the factory style cambered exhaust. Of course it has the stripes, spoilers, F-41 suspension, 15 inch rally wheels, cowl induction hood, 12 bolt rear end, and Muncie 4-speed transmission as a Z-28 should. The body, paint, trim, and chrome are all very nice. The motor compartment and trunk compartments are clean and show well. We will replace the yellow wires with correct GM units to tidy it up a bit. The cowl hood is the real deal with the rear flapper doors to let the cool air into the functional air cleaner. Power front disc brakes and power steering are welcome options. Back to the interior it is extremely nice. It has the correct gauges, deluxe pedal trim, Hurst shifter, newer seat covers, door panels, carpet, and headliner. It also has a full set of seat belts. The chassis is clean and looks good with the aluminum exhaust and clean/smooth floor pans. This is an outstanding Z-28 that anyone would be proud to own. It turns heads and is a blast to drive. Make it yours today with great financing options, cheap collector car insurance, and we will deliver it to your home or office. We service everything we sell so you can buy with confidence.",

            "body": "Look up the definition of muscle car and the second generation Chevelle is almost always directly referenced. Offered in trim levels ranging from stripped economy champ to luxury pavement pounder, Chevrolet produced Chevelle's capable of satisfying the needs of nearly every buyer and every wallet. That legacy of universal appeal has continued across the last forty years, giving fans and aficionados the parts and inspiration to create their own unique hot rods. Take this '71 Super Sport for example. Updated with modern drivetrain components during its extensive frame off restoration, this tastefully modified Chevy turns a traditionally appealing platform into an off-the-charts super star. If you're ready to hit the streets in a head-turning muscle car, have a closer look at this stunning Chevelle! Originally leaving the Baltimore factory in Classic Copper, today it sits in a fresh coat of Mulsanne Blue with white stripes for a crisp look. Actually fresh is a great way of describing this entire car, as the vehicle has less than then 100 miles driven on it since its extensive frame off restoration. Aesthetically, many enthusiasts believe the '71 Chevelle introduced a host of excellent refinements which transformed the 'good' design of the '70 Chevelle into something 'great'. In 1971, the biggest and baddest motor you could shove between the fenders of an all steel Chevrolet passenger car was the mighty LS5 454 V8. For this Chevelle, it was never a 454, so the build team opted to transplant a bullet-proof LS1 coming off a recent freshening where all LSX internals were used in the build. Under the Chevelle is just as impressive as the rest of the build. Take a glance and you'll see that bolted to the potent LS1 is a hydraulic clutch and a Tremec T56 6-speed manual transmission that sends plenty of power down the driveshaft to a 12-bolt equipped with 4.10 posi differential.

The Chevy features plump bench seats with dual arm rests, AC & heat, power steering and power brakes! It's quite the long distance cruiser. Looking at the exterior you'll find two-tone metallic brown and beige paint. The metallic brown lights up once under direct sunlight. The interior carries over the same color combination with a mixture of both leather and cloth. Powering the 40s era beauty is a 350 CID V8, keeping it true to the Chevrolet nature. Backing the 350 engine is a 700R4 automatic 4-spd transmission and 9\" Ford rear end, perfect for the highway and drives around town. Other options include: Vintage AC, AM/FM/CD radio, lumbar support, power brakes, power steering, power seats, tilt wheel, seat belts, and chrome wheel with radial tires. The chrome wheels offer moon style hub caps giving it that hot rod look. The front suspension is borrowed from a Mustang II and rides comfortably and safely with the reassurance of power disc brakes. Aftermarket goodies include: rubber fender rock guards, LED taillights, 3rd brake light, rear speakers, wooden grain Grant GT steering wheel, white faced Autometer gauges, exhaust dump outs(in front of rear wheels), tinted glass, and chrome engine accessories. The white faced gauges, once eliminated, are absolutely stunning. We haven't seen them like this before. This Fleetmaster is a car that will be great for additional customization and/or long cruises in comfort. The 350 engine sounds great with its coated exhaust headers. See the car in action via an HD video at www.gatewayclassiccars.com or our St. Louis showroom. For more information please call 618-271-3000.",

            "body": "Look up the definition of muscle car and the second generation Chevelle is almost always directly referenced. Offered in trim levels ranging from stripped economy champ to luxury pavement pounder, Chevrolet produced Chevelle's capable of satisfying the needs of nearly every buyer and every wallet. That legacy of universal appeal has continued across the last forty years, giving fans and aficionados the parts and inspiration to create their own unique hot rods. Take this '71 Super Sport for example. Updated with modern drivetrain components during its extensive frame off restoration, this tastefully modified Chevy turns a traditionally appealing platform into an off-the-charts super star. If you're ready to hit the streets in a head-turning muscle car, have a closer look at this stunning Chevelle! Originally leaving the Baltimore factory in Classic Copper, today it sits in a fresh coat of Mulsanne Blue with white stripes for a crisp look. Actually fresh is a great way of describing this entire car, as the vehicle has less than then 100 miles driven on it since its extensive frame off restoration. Aesthetically, many enthusiasts believe the '71 Chevelle introduced a host of excellent refinements which transformed the 'good' design of the '70 Chevelle into something 'great'. In 1971, the biggest and baddest motor you could shove between the fenders of an all steel Chevrolet passenger car was the mighty LS5 454 V8. For this Chevelle, it was never a 454, so the build team opted to transplant a bullet-proof LS1 coming off a recent freshening where all LSX internals were used in the build. Under the Chevelle is just as impressive as the rest of the build. Take a glance and you'll see that bolted to the potent LS1 is a hydraulic clutch and a Tremec T56 6-speed manual transmission that sends plenty of power down the driveshaft to a 12-bolt equipped with 4.10 posi differential.

            "body": "For sale in our St. Louis showroom is an iconic 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air convertible. I will go ahead and say this; no manufacturer will ever make a convertible as pleasing as this again. 1957 was the last year of the second generation body style for the Bel Air. It seems as if they stopped because they knew it couldn't get any better. In '57 Chevrolet introduced the 283 CID V8 engine that produced 283 HP. The option of a fuel injected engine was available and is quite rare these days. This Bel Air offers a carbureted 283 V8 engine backed by a 3-spd manual transmission. Both are numbers matching and original to the car. This is an actual mile vehicle as well. At 104,772 original miles, this Bel Air stills holds its original charm. In 2002 the Bel Air was completely restored. The car has just 8,000 miles since it was rebuilt. Boasting its original colors, the Chevy shows beautifully in gloss black and is surrounded by chrome. Looking inside the red and silver interior takes you right back to the 50s. Have a seat, turn the key, and operate the automatic convertible top switch and you'll be wondering why haven't you done this before? The red and silver vinyl interior is paired well with a white convertible top. Options include: AM radio, vinyl interior, wide white walls, and knock off style hub caps. The ????57 Chevy is one of the most recognized icons in the Automotive industry. Stylish and Sporty the there????s no doubt that it????s one of America????s best and most loved cars. Here's the chance of owning a piece of American history that still serves a purpose. Put on the white rimmed sunglasses and enjoy. To view the Bel Air convertible in greater detail, including an HD video and 50 + HD pictures, please visit www.gatewayclassiccars.com or our St. Louis showroom.

It's an original Arizona car with factory air conditioning. Leather interior is also beautiful. Runs and drives great! All scheduled maintenance, Always garaged, Ice cold A/C, Looks & runs great, Low mileage, never seen snow. it has been treated with very much care and respect. The 200 inline 6 was rebuilt during the restoration and is smooth as ever! The tires are almost brand new as well. The frame and suspension components were powder coated and painted during the restoration and look spectacular! The car has a clean title. I am selling this car because I inherited it from my grandpa who has passed and I would like to sell it to someone who can take better care of it then I would be able to. I'm going off to college and will have not have the money or time to keep this thing perfect like he has it right now. I'm a car guy to heart and don't have the heart to keep it where I know it won't get the full attention she may need. I have a host of extra parts for it as well such as spark plugs, rotor button, distributor cap, new windshield washer fluid lines, oil filter, air filter and more! For more information regarding the car or more pictures, Please give me a call, shoot me a text, or send me an e-mail and I will be glad to assist you in any way possible.",
