<br />
<center>HISTORY OF THE INFAMOUS MINI</center>  <br />
<br />
The Mini began its public life on the August 26, 1959. Its designer, Sir Alec Issigonis could not have even dreamed of the impact his little car would have on the world of culture, society and of course automobiles. The Mini was designed simply to be an affordable car that could seat four adults and still be small enough to travel in safety. Originally powered by 850cc 34bhp engine, this was the Mini in its purest form, simple, clean and agile.<br />
<br />
Although the Mini continued to be produced through six decades, it is always the earlier cars that will be remembered and that remain most collectible.  These years saw the Mini go from a "housewives shopping car" to the must have fashion accessory, via international stardom on the rally and road racing scene. It took John Cooper, twice F1 World Champion Constructor, to realize the full potential of the Minis sharp handling and maneuverability. In 1961 the first Mini Cooper hit the streets, firstly with a 997cc engine producing a massive 55bhp, there followed a range of engines for the Cooper from the rare 970cc Cooper S to the ultimate evolution the 76bhp 1275cc S, the car which would form the basis for the Works Rally car.<br />
<br />
The Mini Cooper achieved superstar status when the 91bhp Works spec cars won the Monte Carlo Rally outright for 4 years running from 1964-1967 (although the Minis were disqualified from the 1966 rally for having faulty headlamps!) Now that the Mini had proven itself in front of a world audience, everybody wanted a Cooper, and indeed everybody who was anybody in the 60s had a Cooper, from The Beatles and Peter Sellers to Graham Hill and Enzo Ferrari! Of course they couldn't have any old Cooper they had to be modified. Companies such as Radford and Wood & Pickett who made their name tailor making Rolls Royce's and Bentleys now were turning their hands to Minis, with everything from electric windows and leather seats, to wickerwork sides and hatch backs. <br />
<br />
Thus a trend was started which has been kept up to this day.  So, Mini's can be found in virtually any configuration with modifications to suit the individuals tastes and desired use of the car. The last Mini Cooper was produced in the early 1970's and many people believe that the "best" Mini's were the late 60's, early 70's Mini Cars.  A number of different variations of the Mini were introduced in the 1970's and 1980's (including the Clubman version), but the more "modernized" later cars were never quite the same as the early "enthusiast" Mini's.  <br />

<center>HISTORY - THIS PARTICULAR 1973 AUSTIN MINI</center><br />
<br />
Let us start by saying that this anything but your "normal" Mini.  This example has received some benefit of the finest high performance upgrades and the work on the car was performed was performed by "Mini-Me-Racing", a San Francisco Bay area Mini enthusiast / repair business that has raced his own vintage Mini Cooper for more years than he cares to admit.  Seriously interested buyers can be put directly in touch with "Mini-Me-Racing" to discuss the details of this Mini should there be any specific questions about the car or its "build."  Please contact us directly at 925-846-1451 and we will gladly put you in touch with the mechanic / builder of the car.<br />
<br />
The Mini has been owned by one Bay area enthusiast for 10 years and during that time the car has been totally gone through both mechanically and cosmetically.  The car began life as a small displacement Mini (appears to be a rust free, Australian or New Zealand car) and over the years received significant improvements and engine upgrades. When the Mini was acquired by the current owner it was fitted with a 1275 cc A+ engine and recently received the benefit of a 100% fresh, 1380 cc engine and rebuilt drive-line.  The exterior and interior have also been freshened up resulting in a unique example of a very quick Mini. Since his ownership of the Mini, the owner reports an investment of close to $40,000 in the car! Since the "build" the car has traveld just 3,000 miles (new speedometer / odometer installed prior to mechanical components being completed.  After reviewing the photos and the mechanical specifications, the reader will gain a better appreciation for this fact.<br />
<br />
The owner of the Mini is an active member of the California MOASF (Mini Owner of America San Francisco) and used the car mostly as a weekend, occasional car. It was used for on road driving events and has not been raced or abused in any way.  The car runs and drives extremely well and has been "sorted" by the owner with the assistance of Mini-Me-Racing.<br />

<center>BODY / PAINT / TRIM </center><br />
<br />
The Mini is finished in a striking shade of orange with a touch of pearlescent added to give that extra "pop."  In our opinion it has a great appearance and is not at all "over the top" but very appropriate considering the high performance, sporting nature of this particular Mini.  While not show quality, the paint is much better than the inexpensive "quickie" jobs that we see on many affordable cars.  Additionally, the door jambs, trunk area and underside of the hood all received a fresh coat of paint when the car was re-done and the car is a very presentable driver as the photos suggest.    Specifically, the paint is high gloss, free from any damage to the body or other significant exterior flaws.   <br />
 <br />
The panel fit on the Mini is good, especially considering the vintage of the car and the initial quality/type of vehicle.  The doors open and close securely and fit well. The door handles, windows and locks are operational.  The trunk also is well aligned, and closes properly.  The hood is free from any damage, has a remote release inside the car and fits quite well.  The upgraded Sport Pack flares are in excellent condition and were painted the body color when the car was restored.    <br />
<br />
Perhaps most important, the exterior body panels are (and were prior to the re-paint) free from rust as is the inside of the engine bay, trunk area and typical rust areas (rocker panels, etc.).  Also, the car was very straight prior to the re-paint so it was an excellent candidate for an exterior, cosmetic refurbishing.  The engine bay and the front trunk are very clean and both benefited from complete (both sides) repainting of their "lids."  The engine itself is highly detailed and reflects considerable attention to detail.  The engine and transmission are fresh with an estimated 2-3,000 miles since being totally rebuilt.  <br />
<br />
The trunk is clean and most important, free from moisture, rot and, most important, rust.   The slight discoloration that can be seen in the photos is just that, discoloration. There is absolutely NO rust through in the trunk and the extremely light surface rust could easily be cleaned with steel wool and painted should the new choose to do so. We have left it as is to accurately reflect the true rust free nature of the car.   Prospective buyers are encouraged to review the photographs of underside as well to support the lack of rust on this Mini.  No spare, jack or tools come with the Mini.      <br />
<br />
<center>INTERIOR</center><br />
<br />
If you are familiar with the original or "Classic" Mini's, you are aware that the interiors on the original cars were very "minimalist."  Well, this example has been improved in virtually every respect. While this Mini is an authentic 1973, it has had the benefit of interior upgrades that give the car the appearance of a much newer model. Specifically, the Mini now includes these features / upgrades:<br />
<br />
* Custom fitted, matching Corbeau "Forza" seats (Wide style that will accommodate large / tall driver & adjustable fore and aft)<br />
<br />
* Excellent door panels, upper dash and frontal dash areas<br />
<br />
* Full complement of gauges (Auto Meter) including; Oil pressure, Water Temp, Amp, Tachometer & Speedometer<br />
<br />
* Momo suede steering wheel (flat bottom for larger drivers)<br />
<br />
* Aluminum trim on handbrake and custom shift knob<br />
<br />
* 6-point seat belts for the front passengers for added safety<br />
<br />
* Rear seat removed with a large speaker installed in the custom rear enclosure<br />
<br />
* Roll bar<br />
<br />
* Fire extinguisher<br />
<br />
* Excellent carpet <br />
<br />
* Mini logo mats<br />
<br />
* Beautiful headliner<br />
<br />
* Sun-visors in place and in excellent condition<br />
<br />
* Excellent sound system <br />
 <br />
The front seats are excellent condition and are free from rips, tears, or damage.  The carpeting was recently upgraded (replaced) to improve the appearance of the interior of the Mini.  The floor panels were 100% solid with only slight "patina".We have included a photo that shows how solid the floors are in this car and also undercarriage photographs that will provide interested buyers with the rust free nature of this Mini  <br />
<br />
The door panels are also in very good original condition as is the dash.  The hardware, trim and gauges are excellent and there are working dash lights and even a functional interior light (unusual on any vintage Mini!)  The wiper work but there are no washers.    <br />
<br />
The rear seat has been eliminated and deemed as un-necessary for a Mini of this type.  The interior panels are virtually free from any damage or signs of wear including the seats, door panels, headliner and dash.  <br />
 <br />
The glass on the car is very good, the windows function properly and the electrical system is in good working order having been recently re-done. For some reason, the fuel gauge reads full when empty and empty when full.  All other gauges work fine.<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
<br />
* Front mounted center grill driving lights<br />
<br />
* Large chrome quick release gas cap<br />
<br />
* Mini "S" and 1275 logos on back of car (not correct for this vehicle)<br />
<br />
* Removable stickers from Seven Enterprises, Mini-Me-Racing and SRacer.com<br />
<br />

<br />
* in addition to the purchase price of the vehicle, California buyers will be subject to sales tax, documentation fee, DMV transfer fees and license/registration.  Out-of-state buyers will be responsible for the purchase price of the vehicle and any local taxes/fees will be bear responsibility to pay in their respective state.

<br />
* While we encourage telephone calls to discuss this vehicle in greater detail we will not respond to inquiries asking "What is the reserve'?

<br />
* As with any collectible vehicle of this vintage we are unable to provide a warranty or guarantee of condition. However, we make every effort to accurately represent our vehicles, and highlight both positive items as well as areas that require attention. We ask that prospective buyers consider our EBay history/feedback (User name never22many), standing in the community, length of time in business, and other factors when purchasing a collectible vehicle from Classic Cars Ltd.<br />
<br />
* Please keep in mind that, as with any used vehicle, minor cosmetic issues/flaws may be present that add to the "patina" of the car and are a part of even the best restoration, or even a relatively new, used "pre-owned" vehicle.  Also, ownership of a vintage Porsche (or any other type vehicle, for that matter) is more enjoyable if the owner is familiar with the "realities" of these unique cars.  Unlike more modern day vehicles, these cars require regular, ongoing care/maintenance and some mechanical knowledge, patience, and understanding that can make the experience considerably more pleasant.  That said, Porsche owner's will tell you (emphatically) that they love their cars and wouldn't trade them for anything!<br />
<br />
* Finally, much of the information (especially the details pertaining to the engine rebuild and other improvements) has been provided by the vehicles owner.  We have every reason to believe that it is 100% accurate, but for obvious reasons are unable to verify all of the information.  As a result, we are unable to guarantee the accuracy of the information provided in this narrative. <br />

<center>PURCHASING A COLLECTOR VEHICLE - THINGS TO CONSIDER</center><br />
<br />
As always, we recommend that you carefully review the seller's background of any collector car being sold over the Internet. We believe that it is important to ask yourself a number of questions including, but not limited to:<br />
<br />
-	How long have they been in business? <br />
<br />
-	How much experience do they have with collector cars?  <br />
<br />
-	How many positive collector car vehicle sales have completed (positive EBay feedback)? <br />
<br />
-	How detailed/complete is the description of the vehicle? <br />
<br />
-	Do the photos show details of the interior, exterior, top, chrome, etc. or are they simply "Glamour Shots" taken from a distance? <br />
<br />
-	Does the seller have a surety bond to protect the financial transaction? <br />
<br />
-	What about insurance, licensing by the state, and a local business license? <br />
<br />
-	Does the seller (if a business) have any DMV (Motor Vehicle) complaints and/or other history of legal action, grievances? <br />
<br />
-	Do they enjoy a favorable local and national/international reputation?  <br />
<br />
-	Can the seller assist with funding sources, transport and out of state/country sales? <br />

<br />
* Classic Cars Ltd. has been in the same, small, California town for over 16 years. We operate a small, indoor showroom, and specialize in the sale, consignment, and purchase of sports, high performance and specialty vehicles of all types.
