This directory contains the raw data files downloaded from carqueryapi.com
(make/model info)

This data has serious limitations (missing make/model/year combos, some
bogus-looking stuff, mix of curb & gross weights) but it's a start. For
now I'm loading this as-is using the provided sql file then massaging into
a table format to use go-forward. Later we may either hand-edit the csv
data, augment with additional loads that we merge into the db master
tables, or throw this out entirely & replace with better data.

But for now... here it is. Checking into git so we can leverage this in
db build scripts and so we don't loose the info.
