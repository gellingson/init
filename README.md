Read me? In a word, don't :-).

This repo implemented a sytem to aggregate interesting
used car listings from across many sources (web and API),
manage that inventory of listings, and present them
through a simple searchable interface. It's a simple
django website with minimal jquery javascript over a
combination of MySQL and elasticsearch.

This was set up to quickly get the startup Carbyr, Inc.
(now defunct) off the ground in 2014.

The code in this repo is not currently being deployed
and run anywhere and has no further business purpose.

I'm just leaving it here in case I want to crib something
from it or check my notes on something in the future.

If YOU want to crib something from it you're probably
barking up the wrong tree but... while this code is
copyright Carbyr, Inc and isn't being formally made
available under any free license I (Glenn Ellingson) am
the sole author, the company is defunct, and I don't really
care if you borrow if for some reason this has some use to
you.

PS: if you DO for some reason want to look at what's
here, I recommend starting with either the inventory
management & import code (inventory/importer.py) or
the web views (oglweb/listings/views.py).

PPS: this was a quick hack to get a startup up and
running (for which it worked), and it was also my
first work in python, and my first code after a break
of a few years (and many years working on some pretty
old patterns), so please pardon the mess!
